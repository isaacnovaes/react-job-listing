## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React hooks and Context API

### Continued development

It was my first React project. I am glad I could use all the React features I have just learned, such as props, Hooks, and the Context API. Now that I feel comfortable with React, I will start doing tons of projects to practice React development.
